## Overview

Genomic analyses require Bioinformatics skills. Therefore, the first part of the course is a tour through 3 critical technologies every genome analyst needs: Unix/Linux, R, and Python. In the second part of the course, you will use your newfound skills to perform experiments in RNA-Seq, variant detection, metagenomics, etc.

## Instructors

BIS180L is normally taught by Dr. Julin Maloof, but Dr. Maloof is on sabbatical so the instructors and course content are different this quarter.

Ian Korf - Professor in MCB and Genome Center
Nikhil Joshi - Analyst at the UCD Bioinformatics Core
Lilith Marinho-Davis - TA from IGG program (and Ian's lab)

## Discord

The class has a Discord Channel. The instructors monitor the Discord channel, so if you have a question outside of classroom hours, this is a good place to ask. Please join the Discord server here: https://discord.gg/QTsBfMNp75

## Office Hours

You can schedule a 30 min session with the professor via Calendly. https://calendly.com/iankorf/zoom

## Grading

Each unit ends with a graded written assignment. The grade depends on several factors.

    Completeness - the degree to which all the questions were answered
    Correctness - the degree to which the answers are correct
    Neatness - the overall organization of the text, figures, and documents
    Togetherness - citizenship within the class (you are expected to come to class, interact with people, and collaborate with your lab partner)

There is no final exam for the course because you are graded on assignments on a regular basis.
